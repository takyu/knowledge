# run envrironment

V8<https://v8.dev/> is one of the main engines running javaScript.  
However, the engine running JavaScript is different for each browser.  
Global Objects and this are prepared before JavaScripts executes.  
The global object of the browser is the window object.  

## Gloabal Object

Objects that can be accessed from anywhere in the code generated by the JS engine.

## execution context

Context and situation in which the code is executed.  
There are three types of execution contexts. 

1. global context

	1. Variables and functions in the context of execution.
	
	2. Global Object

	3. this


2. function context

	1. Context and situation in which the code is executed.

	2. arguments

	3. super

	4. this

	5. external variables

3. eval context

## Call Stack

The stack of contexts which the running code has traced.  
This time, *anonymous->c->b->a*.  
Anonymous indicates nothing, and here refers to the global context.  
This kind of stack mechanism is called LIFO(Last In, First Out).

## Hoisting

Placing variable and function definitions declared in the context into memory before code execution.  
However, the definitions of variables and functions differ slightly depending on the JS engine.
