# Question.1 :
# Forward requests that come in .html to php with the same file name.
#
# For example)
# http://localhost:8888/Basic_apache/12/rewrite-test/file1.html
# -> http://localhost:8888/Basic_apache/12/rewrite-test/file1.php
#
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /Basic_apache/12/rewrite-test/

# /? is match whether the previous letter is there or not.
# this case, /12/ or 12/
#RewriteRule /?rewrite-test/(.+)\.html$ $1.php [R]

#
# Question.2 :
# When sending a request for a file in rewrite-test/sub1,
# if a file exists in sub2 with the same file name, please show the file in sub2.
# If the file does not exist in sub2, display the file in sub1.
#
# For exampleï¼‰
# http://localhost:8888/Basic_apache/12/rewrite-test/sub1/file1.html
# -> http://localhost:8888/Basic_apache/12/rewrite-test/sub2/file1.html
# 
# http://localhost:8888/Basic_apache/12/rewrite-test/sub1/file2.html
# -> Internal Redirect does not execute.
